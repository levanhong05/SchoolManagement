School Management
===================

for exercise and homework

require Qt 5.1 and g++ 4.7+ for C++11 features

In Windows, require Visual Studio 2013 and Qt5(so you have to compile Qt5 first currently). MinGW with Qt5 should also work, not tested

don't support MinGW for lack support of C++ locale.
